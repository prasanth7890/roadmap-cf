# roadmap-cf


# Newbie
- master 1 programming language.
- learn time & space complexity
- learn STL
#### Topics:
- Math - LCM, HCF, Divisors, Multiples, Modular Arithmetic
- Recursion
#### Tips:
- Don't run after topics (there is no need now).
- Focus on building Implementation Skills.
- Don't get disheartened.

# Pupil
#### Topics:
- Binary Search - (most important - advanced - simple version is not enough)
- monotonic function
- Number Theory
	- Binary Exponentiation
	- seive of eratosthenes
	- euclidean algorithm
- Prefix Sum - (not just basic - try to solve asmanyaspossible versions )
- Greedy 
	 - master standard greedy algorithms (there are some standard problems)
	 - Non standard problems 
	 - go to cf -> select greedy tag -> solve random problems more
- Bit Manipulation - when you are high pupil / about to specialist rating, start solving these
#### Tips:
- solve ad-hoc problems
- upsolve contests
- Give Enough Contests


# Specialist
#### Topics:
- 2 Pointers
- Adv Number Theory
	- Fermat's & Euler's Theorem
	- Mod Inverse & Combinatorics
- Dynamic Programming - (IMP!!!!)
	- Solve Both standard & Non standard - can be found in CF blogs or CSES website
	- after that, go to cf -> apply dynamic programming tag -> solve problems in range of [1600, 1700]
	- Dp with Bitmasking
- Graphs - (not advanced - basic to medium lvl)
	- DFS, BFS & Applications
	- Shortest Path Algorithms
- Trees
	- Basics, Subtree Precomputation
	- Binary Lifting
#### BONUS (basics are enough at this point)
- ##### Range Queries
	- Segment trees, or sparse tables or fenwick trees
- ##### Strings
	- String Hashing
	- Tries
#### Tips:
- START **PROVING** APPROACHES
- START **READING BLOGS** ON CP 
- AVOID LEARNING IRRELEVANT TOPICS



# RESOURCES
#### 1. Cp-algorithms - cant ignore this one
#### 2. CSES - the most imp problems for each topic
#### 3. Solve -200 to +200 Rating problems on CF
